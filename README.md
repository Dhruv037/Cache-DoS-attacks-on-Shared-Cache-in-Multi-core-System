# Cache-DoS-attacks-on-Shared-Cache-in-Multi-core-System
In Denial-of-Service (DoS) attack, attacker makes lots of requests in a short time interval to a service provider, with an aim to block its service by overloading it. In Cache DoS attack, the attacker generates such frequent read/write requests that fills up read/write register associated with shared cache, leading to its blocking. This project aims to perform and analyse Denial-of-service (DoS) attacks on shared cache in multicore systems. By executing DoS attacker task, we are able to increase execution time for victim task running on a separate dedicated core.
